# Conclusions

In conclusion, the regression models that most accurately fit our data set were the OLS and PCR regressions. However, the difference in error between these and the other regressions was not statistically significant. Some of the most valuable insight came from comparing across all of the regression models. For example, we were able to see that variables such as credit limit, credit rating, and income drastically affected balance across all five regression models. Much of this data is aligned with intuitions regarding credit card debt, such as the higher your limit the higher your balance may be.
