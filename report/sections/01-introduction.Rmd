# Introduction

In this project, we applied model selection methods on different regression models introduced in _Chapter 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization (from **"An Introduction to Statistical Learning"** by James et al)_. The 5 regression models we practiced are _Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Principle Components Regression and Partial Least Square Regression_. In order to find the best parameter (or coefficients) for those regression models, we splitted our datasets into train and test groups, performed 10-fold cross validation on each model respectively, and in the end chose the best model with the least cross-validation error.
