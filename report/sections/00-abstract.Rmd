#Abstract
We perform a predictive modeling process applied on the data set Credit in order to decipher how factors such as Income, Age, Education, and more influence the amount of credit card debt to a person. Our analysis is based off of Chapter 6 from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*, "Linear Model Selection and Regularization".
